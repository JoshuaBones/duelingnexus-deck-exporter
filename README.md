# duelingnexus-deck-exporter
Chrome extension for DuelingNexus.com https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dueling-nexus-deck-export/pjgponfjenccmekfflegcaflngfbokde<br />
Export your deck as ydk, import/export as YDKe link, toggle Goat/Edison erratas and download all your decks as a zip file!<br />The old exporter seems to have been taken down, so this was made in its place.<br />
Feel free to suggest new features.

## Features

### Export
* Export your deck to a ydk file
* Export your deck to a ydke link to your clipboard
* Export all decks as zip with individual ydk files
* Export all but with all custom erratas replaced

### Import
* Paste YDKe link anywhere on the page to overwrite the current deck

### Editor Improvements
* Errata toggle
