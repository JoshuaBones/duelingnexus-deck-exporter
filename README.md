# duelingnexus-deck-exporter
Chrome extension which adds a deck export button to DuelingNexus's deck editor

This is pending approval on the app store, but in the meantime it can be added manually by going to Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Enable Developer Mode (top-right) -> Load Unpacked -> select the downloaded & extracted extension folder<br/>
Or you can paste the contents of content.js into your chrome/firefox console, and it will add the button to that page.
