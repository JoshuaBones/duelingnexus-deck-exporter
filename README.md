# duelingnexus-deck-exporter
Chrome extension which adds a deck export button to DuelingNexus's deck editor. The old exporter seems to have been taken down, so this was made in its place.<br />
Each feature is shown in an image below. Feel free to suggest new ones.

This is available on the app store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dueling-nexus-deck-export/pjgponfjenccmekfflegcaflngfbokde
